# Accordion Email Template
Basic accordion email template, making use of radio buttons to expand/close sections.   
Currently only one section at a time will remain open. 
If you wanted all sections to remain open unless the user closed them, then the radio buttons would need changing to checkboxes.

## Where it works
This should work on iOS devices native apps, some android native apps and AOL Webmail. Otherwise it will degrade disgracefully to a stacked layout.
